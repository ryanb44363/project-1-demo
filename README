# Interactive Math Graph Plotter

**Interactive Math Graph Plotter** is a local JavaScript application that visualizes quadratic equations in the form `ax^2 + bx + c`, with interactive graph manipulation and real-time updates using WebSocket communication.

## Features

* Real-time plotting of quadratic functions via WebSocket
* Zoom and pan control with mouse input
* Point selection and contextual action menu
* Drag-to-select up to 3 points simultaneously
* Modular architecture: clean separation of HTML, CSS, JS
* All updates communicated via JSON messages through WebSocket
* Constants easily configured in `constants.json`
* Embedded demo GIF to preview full functionality

## Requirements

### Node.js

* Version: v14+
* Download: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### NPM Packages

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Includes:

* `ws`: WebSocket server for live communication

---

## Running the Project

Start the WebSocket server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to start interacting with the graph.

---

## Usage Tips

* Modify `constants.json` to change graph scale, dot sizes, and label visibility.
* Use scroll to zoom in/out, click and drag to pan the graph.
* Right-click or long-press on dots to bring up the action menu.

---

## Future Improvements

* Saving/loading plotted equations
* Drag-and-drop points to modify coefficients
* Multi-function plotting (e.g., sine, exponential)
* Mobile touch support
